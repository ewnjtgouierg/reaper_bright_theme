Reaper doesn't have an official bright theme, and the ones created by users are all too amateur.

This is a hack of the default theme in attempt to make it bright. It is very rough, sketchy and unfinished*,
but for me it is still better than using the default one.

If other people like me, who always prefer a black text on a white background, exist, they might find this useful.

I may or may not try to improve it further later.

*I struggled finding respective settings for many elements, also themes format doesn't seem to be fully documented.
